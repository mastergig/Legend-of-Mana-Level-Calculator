# Legend-of-Mana-Level-Calculator
Project made to calculate best level up for the game Legend of Mana

## What happened?
I found out the best weapon choices for leveling up on Legend of Mana.

I know, it's an old game, but I was not sure people found out the best combinations so I made this.

I used some research to find out the level up atributes from weapons and checked into the game for the consistency of the data, made the code and used async methods for faster resolutions.

Sorry for the bad written code btw, this was made for fun.

## I don't want to run your code
The code found 6 possible combinations with the most status distributed (618)

Here, the best choices my code found:

> 84 Sword, 13 Staff, 1 Hammer
```
97 POW, 99 SKL, 99 DEF, 85 MAG, 75 HP, 78 SPR, 85 CHM
```

> 83 Sword, 13 Staff, 2 Hammer
```
98 POW, 99 SKL, 98 DEF, 85 MAG, 75 HP, 78 SPR, 85 CHM
```

> 85 Sword, 11 Staff, 2 Hammer
```
99 POW, 99 SKL, 99 DEF, 84 MAG, 75 HP, 78 SPR, 84 CHM
```

> 82 Sword, 13 Staff, 3 Hammer
```
98 POW, 99 SKL, 98 DEF, 85 MAG, 75 HP, 78 SPR, 85 CHM
```

> 82 Sword, 14 Staff, 2 Axe 
```
96 POW, 99 SKL, 99 DEF, 85 MAG, 75 HP, 79 SPR, 85 CHM
```

> 82 Sword, 13 Staff, 3 Glove
```
97 POW, 99 SKL, 99 DEF, 84 MAG, 76 HP, 78 SPR, 85 CHM
```

# What's next?
Next I'll try to make the best pet training guides for every pet. Since I found out the best detailed guide for them, I supose it will be a piece of cake to code it. 

Someday I dream of making the best code for Legend of Mana blacksmith auto recipes, but it's really a big complex system, I don't think it will be fun to make.
